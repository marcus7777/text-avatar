# v-text-avatar
Text Avater like in google's 'inbox'
(now in Vue JS)

Designed for reading a list of names with a consistent avatar if no image, with a name and email to uniquely identify somebody, they will receive their own colour, and initials derived. I find it important for me to recognise and quickly identify them. 

Requires no network access.
